Hi, there. The thought of building a personal blog website came to me years ago, but due to the regulation and tedious process, I kept loafing (. Anyway, you've seen it, which means I've overcome them. If you wonder why I write in English (I'm Chinese), my only words are, it's for international friends (don't know if there're any). Actually it's for ~~showing off~~.

I build it with Hexo and Nginx and it has noble HTTPS. ~~You'll never know that I spent a night configuring it.~~ The backend of Hexo is running on Nodejs, which will quit when I end the SSH session. Hexo doesn't support SSL either. I hate it. So I use Hexo to generate static pages and use Nginx to run the service.

In my blog, you can read
 - essay (personal thoughts)
 - article (knowledge)
 - writeup (solution)

If any of it interest you, please check my blog. I might add RSS later. I will try my best to update the blog. ~~Who knows if I am loafing~~

In case I don't see you, good day and good night.
